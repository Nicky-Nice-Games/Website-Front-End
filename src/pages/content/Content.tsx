            RIT was born of an unlikely institutional marriage of an influential
            cultural association, the Rochester Athenaeum, founded in 1829, and
            a technical training school, the Mechanics Institute, founded in
            1885. The institute adopted the name Rochester Institute of
            Technology in 1944 and awarded its first bachelor of science degree
            in 1955. A 1961 decision to leave downtown Rochester for farmland in
            the suburban town of Henrietta put RIT on its path to pre-eminence
            as a global university. Today, the universityâ€™s reputation and reach
            go well beyond Rochester. We have partnerships on nearly every
            continent and overseas campuses located in China, Croatia, Dubai,
            and Kosovo.
