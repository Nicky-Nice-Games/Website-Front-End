      "As the mascot of the game, Gizmo's design is based on the first IGM logo from roughly 2011 to 2018, using the \"M\" as his head. Gizmo's toy and ghost designs were created as separate concepts, but both would be utilized in the final design of the character. The wooden toy form is inspired by other blocky wooden string dolls, which had similar shape language to the original ghost form."
